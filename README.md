This repository contains my implementation of the **Bankist Website Project**, part of *The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!* by Jonas Schmedtmann.  

The goal of this project is to practice and master modern JavaScript techniques by building a **realistic marketing website** for the fictional bank **Bankist**.  


## 📑 Project Overview  

The project builds upon the previously developed **Bankist application** by adding a polished marketing website. The HTML and CSS are provided in the starter files, while all **JavaScript interactivity and dynamic effects** are implemented from scratch.  

#### Features
- **Section reveal on scroll** – content fades and slides into view.  
- **Lazy loading of images** – optimised performance as images load only when visible.  
- **Sticky navigation bar** – the menu remains fixed while scrolling.  
- **Menu hover effect** – non-hovered links fade when hovering over a menu item.  
- **Modal window** – reusable popup for user interaction.  
- **Tabbed component** – commonly used UI element for displaying grouped content.  
- **Smooth scrolling** – animated scroll to sections triggered by buttons/links.  
- **Slider component** – navigation arrows and dots allow cycling through slides.  


## ⭐️ Purpose & Benefits  

By completing this project, I strengthened my skills in:  
- Writing **clean, modern JavaScript** using best practices.  
- Handling **DOM manipulation** and **event-driven programming**.  
- Creating **reusable UI components** (tabs, modals, sliders).  
- Optimising **website performance** with techniques like lazy loading.  

This website resembles a **professional marketing page** and is a great portfolio project showcasing modern front-end development skills.  


## 🗃️ Starter Files  

The provided starter files include:  
- `index.html` → HTML structure of the project.  
- `style.css` → A comprehensive stylesheet with hundreds of lines of CSS.  
- `script.js` → JavaScript file where all interactivity is implemented.  
- Pre-written **modal window code**, reused from the previous project.  


## 👩🏻‍💻 Initial Setup  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bankist-website.git
   cd bankist-website
   ```

2. Open the project in your editor (e.g., VS Code).

3. Run with Live Server (or similar tool) to see the website in action.


## 📝 Learning Outcomes

- Preventing default browser behaviour (event.preventDefault() in modal links).
- Using forEach to attach event listeners instead of traditional loops.
- Writing modular and reusable code for UI interactions.
- Understanding how the DOM works behind the scenes.
